## Microsoft Cloud Security Scorecard (Benchmark)

### December 2023 UPDATE:
 - Added Scorecard sheet to enable the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to be used for outcome-based consulting initiatives.
 - Added by Jason Layton (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonlayton/)

### How To Use
1. Go through each control domain sheet and ensure all the scoring columns are empty. The scorecard will automatically reflect this.
2. Perform the cloud security assessment for each control domain and enter a score of '1' in the column according to the implementation status of the control.
3. Once complete, the control table in the scorecard sheet (far left) will show all the controls for each domain coloured in GREEN and marked with 1's against each control. The 'assessment scorecard' will reflect the total score percentages of each of the control domains that have been assessed.
4. You do not need to modify anything in the scorecard sheet. It will produce scoring data as you perform the security assessment for each of the control domains.
